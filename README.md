# Flappy-Down
The BEST remake of flappy bird made with CHATGPT

LOOK AT THE RELEASES FOR THE .EXE ----->

WARNING: THE GAME CREATES .txt FILES TO BE ABLE TO SAVE YOUR HIGH SCORE. DUE TO THIS, SOME ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARES THINK ITS MALWARE. IF THIS IS OF A CONCERN TO YOU, DOWNLOAD AN OLDER VERSION, I WILL MAKE AN UPDATE THAT FIXES THIS.

Dev Notes:
    1) I am having issues making the new version (DevVer 4.5) and getting it to a .exe while keeping the audio files working. I am currently working on a fix.
